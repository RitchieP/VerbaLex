Automatic Speech Recognition system for non-native English speakers. This project is a university final-year 
project. Inspired by Google's [Project Euphonia](https://sites.research.google/euphonia/about/), this project aims 
to replicate a similar machine-learning model for more people. 

## Setup
### Environment
The environment for this project uses [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/). To set up the 
anaconda environment, follow the guide on PyCharm's documentation about [configuring a conda 
environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html).

### Development
This project is currently developed by using [OpenAI's Whisper model](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small) from HuggingFace. The project will fine-tune the model based on different accents from different countries.
